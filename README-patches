unrebar.patch
  - build with make rather than rebar, to fit into our build / deploy process.

uneunit.patch
  - build without eunit, so we can build on R12B-5.

10-crypto.patch
  - remove references to the crypto app, so that we can run without it
    on platforms where it's hard to get hold of.

ssl.patch
  - fix SSL on webmachine, see https://issues.basho.com/show_bug.cgi?id=769
    (unresolved at time of writing).
